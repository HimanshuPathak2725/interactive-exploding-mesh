# Interactive Exploding Mesh

This project showcases an interactive 3D mesh using Three.js, which reacts to the user's mouse position to create an "exploding" effect. It uses custom GLSL vertex and fragment shaders for visual effects.

## Features

- **Interactive Mesh:** The mesh distorts based on the mouse position.
- **Custom Shaders:** Implements vertex and fragment shaders for dynamic lighting and displacement effects.
- **Realistic Lighting:** Combines ambient and directional lighting for a lifelike appearance.
